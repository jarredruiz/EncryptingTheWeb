 <h2>Secure Internet</h2>
 <p>Hyptext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) is a protocol that is responsible for transmitting HTML and other web documents over the web.
    HTTP was developed by a man Time Berners-Lee. With his invention of the World Wide Web, it required HTTP so that information can be exchanged. 
	Unfortunatley, HTTP is old and very much outdated. It is time to move on from HTTP and move onto more secure form of data encryption, HTTPS. 
	Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure has to become the new standard for encryption on the World Wide Web. It is less vulnerable to malicious attacks by cyberhackers. 
	The "S" at the end of the protocol is a marking that means the website is secure. This more secure protocol verifies whether the site is safe to use and also verifies that all user information is encrypted.
	If there is no "S" or lock symbol next to the URL, then the site does not encrypt information sent to the server which leaves it vulnerable to attack.
	According to the Federal Cheif Information Officer's Council, HTTPS guarentees three things:
 </p>
 <ol>
	<li>Confidentility</li>
	<li>Integrity</li>
	<li>Authenticity</li>
</ol>

 <p id="httpseverywhere">A big contributor in trying to standardize HTTPS is EFF; they have developed beneficial tools to help the everyday user protect themselves from online threats.
 A tool that was released by EFF is called HTTPS Everywhere. It is a web browser extension that encrypts your communication between your computer and the web server. 
 By doing this is acts as a security feature, especially when you are browsing sites that may not be HTTPS secured by an certificate authority. If you would like to download this browser extension, please <a href= "https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here!</a> <!--External Link Opens in New Tab-->
