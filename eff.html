 <h2>What is EFF?</h2>
 <p><span class="about">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a non-profit organization that works to fight for freedom, justice, and innovation for all in the technological world we live in.
	EFF was founded in 1990 to set standards for the emerging technologies that improve each year. The large community of EFF members use their expertise in technology and law to fight for the freedom and safety in the digital world.
    EFF has won many legal cases involving free speech and privacy. For example, they won the case that made Facebook update their policies so law enforcement officers wouldn't create fake profiles.<br>
