 <h2>What is A Certificate?</h2>
 <p>A certificate is an indication that the site you are trying to reach is secure only when signed by a Certificate authority(CA).<br>
 In a certificate includes the domain, public key, private key, signature by CA, and other information regarding the certificate itself.<br>
 There are two types of encryption that certificates use in order to authenticate client and server, they are asymmetric encryption and symmetric encryption.<br>
 Asymmetric can be referred to as public key which works for encryption because any data that is encrypted by the public key can only be decrpyted by the private key.<br>
 Only the Certificate contains the public key and private key which ensures a secure connection between the client and the serer. Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption used after a session has been created.<br>
 After the pubic and private keys are used for asymmetric encryption, the session keys are used by both client and server.
